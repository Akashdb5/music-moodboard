### Key Components

| Layer                   | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**            | Next.js + Tailwind app handling Auth0 login, mood/image input, and playlist UI                |
| **Agent Layer**         | Node.js + OpenAI API (LLM reasoning and playlist generation)                                  |
| **Data Tier**           | Vector DB (LlamaIndex / Pinecone) storing public + private knowledge                          |
| **Spotify Integration** | Uses `Search`, `Recommendations`, `Audio Features`, `Create Playlist` APIs                    |
| **Auth0 Integration**   | Handles authentication, token vault (Spotify tokens), and FGA access control                  |
| **FGA Enforcement**     | Controls document retrieval (e.g., `dev_terms_integration.md` visible only to role=developer) |

### Example Auth0 Role Mapping

| Role          | Access                | Description                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `normal_user` | Public docs only      | Can use app and create playlists                   |
| `developer`   | Public + Private docs | Can integrate, test APIs, and view revenue metrics |
| `admin`       | All access            | Manage Auth0, API keys, and dataset versions       |

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Developer Integration Guide

### 3.1 Getting Started

To integrate the **Music Moodboard AI agent** into another app:

1. Obtain a developer API key from Auth0.
2. Authenticate with the following endpoint:

   ```bash
   POST /api/auth/token
   Authorization: Bearer <Auth0_Developer_Token>
   ```
3. Retrieve your Spotify token from the **Token Vault**.
4. Make requests to:

   ```bash
   POST /api/playlist/generate
   {
     "prompt": "music for coding at 3am",
     "mode": "text",
     "preferences": ["lofi", "focus"]
   }
   ```

### 3.2 Response Example

```json
{
  "playlist_name": "Night Code Flow",
  "spotify_playlist_url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...",
  "tracks": [
    {"name": "Sleepy Samurai", "artist": "Shinobi LoFi"},
    {"name": "Midnight Syntax", "artist": "Code Beats"}
  ]
}
```

### 3.3 SDK / Integration Snippet

For JavaScript apps:

```js
import { generatePlaylist } from 'music-moodboard-sdk';

const playlist = await generatePlaylist({
  prompt: "Chill techno for a long drive",
  authToken: process.env.AUTH0_TOKEN
});
console.log(playlist.url);
```
